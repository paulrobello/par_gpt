<instructions>
    <instruction>Sort the reported bugs by severity, using a scale from 1 to 5 (5 is the most severe).</instruction>
    <instruction>Identify critical bugs that would cause crashes first, then address non-critical bugs.</instruction>
    <instruction>Use the examples to understand how to format the output.</instruction>
    <instruction>Always provide a recommended fix for each bug.</instruction>
    <instruction>Keep bug descriptions concise and clear.</instruction>
    <instruction>Provide search pattern for ctrl-f that the user can use to find the bug.</instruction>
